# responsive_registration_form

This project focuses on the creation of a web-based registration form, a fundamental aspect of web development. The form is designed to collect user information such as name, email, username, password, and potentially additional details. It incorporates client-side validation to ensure data accuracy, including email format verification and password strength requirements. The form's responsive design guarantees functionality across various devices and screen sizes. Upon submission, successful registration prompts a confirmation page or message, acknowledging the completion of the registration process.
